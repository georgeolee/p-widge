# p-widge

##### Run the app [here](https://p-widge.netlify.app).

A browser sketch pad for mocking up 2D particle effects. For the asset artist who just needs a minimal-setup environment to preview a texture and maybe tweak a few settings as they work. Everything runs out of the box, and no prior experience with any game engine or other particle system is required.

Anything not listed here... I haven't tried :thinking:

## Emitter Shapes

##### Create an emission map [here](https://map-e.netlify.app).

The default emitter is just a single point, but custom emitters can be created from PNG files. I made a simple [editor](https://github.com/georgeolee/map-e) with the specific aim of streamlining the process, but any program that exports to PNG will work. Emission vectors are encoded as colors â€“ similar to the approach used in normal mapping, but without the z-channel.

## Performance

I've tried to keep framerate within a reasonable level on older hardware. That being said, results may vary according to device, browser, and settings.
